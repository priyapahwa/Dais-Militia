This repository has been created for project 'Militia'. Militia envisions to a colloborative approach between civilians and military towards strengthening national security .<br/> <br/>
🔭  With India topping the charts in terms of threats to national security, how can a civilian assist the military? Ironically, the greatest threat to national security arises when individuals take a step back, fearful of the unforeseeable consequences thereby hindering its prevention. A collaborative action taken from both sides is the sole way out to prevent any potential attacks.
But, where to address crucial tips in a chaotic situation that might assist the military in their operations?
Even with information at hand, it is difficult for the military to distinguish a legit tip from another spiteful suggestion.
 <br/> <br/> 
🔭 The motive behind our project is to provide an interface for civilians to collaborate with the military. The interface comprises a form where civilians can report any suspicious activity anonymously. The data sent from the form is encrypted and can only be accessed by a single admin, ensuring security. Different prioritization techniques are implemented to ensure the authenticity of the tips.
